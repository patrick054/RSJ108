Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Identifying Your Interests.</h3>
              <p>The first step into becoming a broadcast journlaist is defining what your interests are. This takes a little bit of self reflection to decide what you would like to do. Due to the wide variety of options when it comes to broadcast journalism, the first step is deciding. Do you like radio or TV more? What beat would you like to report on, sports, entertainment, or maybe even weather? Are there any social issues that you would report on? During this step, take some time to think about realistic goals that you can set for yourself.</p>

              <h3>Building Your Skills.</h3>
              <p>This step is important for any aspiring journalist to take, not just broadcast. In doing this step, you are building a foundation on which your career as a journalist will blossom from. Building interpersonal skills are important because as a journalist, it is important that your community knows you, and that you are listening to them. Listening, rhetoric, and public speaking skills come next. Often times journalists find themselves interviewing members of the community and being able to listen, understand communicate what you have gathered is an important journalistic skill. Finally, learning shorthand will allow you to write much faster than you have been able to before.</p>

              <h3>Pursuing an Education.</h3>
              <p>The first step in pursuing an education in journalism is identifying the degree that you will recieve. Most journalism jobs accept a bachelor's degree and there are tons of undergraduate degrees that focus on broadcast journalism and communications! Next, you have to pick your school. When considering schools, debate things such as internships, the community, as well as career opportunities if you are to stay in that area for your career. Finally, make the most of your degree! In order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, become involved in other things around campus! If you devote all of your time to your studies they will feel more like a chore rather than a career.</p>

              <p>There are many ways that you can gain experience in broadcast journalism. Joining a local organization is a way that you can gain experience as well as find jobs that might be open for when you need them. If you are still a student, try joining the student run newspaper or the journalism club! Looking for an internship at your local news station is another way that you can get hands on experience in journalism. Always save your past work so you are able to build a portfolio as well as making a digital portfolio to show to future employers. Social media is a powerful tool that you can use to show your experience as well and sharing your work!</p>

              <p>Once you have completeted all of the previous steps, it's time to start your career. It is important to start out small at first as it is not very common that your first job as a journalist will be something super glamorous. Geting yourself noticed is an important step in making it to the big leagues. Then, you need to prove your value. Proving that you are worth the time and money is something that every employer is looking for and this will benefit you greatly. The most important thing to keep in mind while you are achieving your success is to be patient. Patience truly is a virtue. Good opportunities will come if you prove your worth and network yourself, but keep in mind they will not come overnight. Congrats! You're now a broadcast journalist!</p>
